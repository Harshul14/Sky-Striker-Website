# Sky Striker

Master the skies, blast planes, top scores!

Sky Striker is an adrenaline-pumping aerial shooting game designed to test your precision, agility, and strategic thinking. Your objective is simple yet exhilarating: take aim, time your shots perfectly, and unleash devastating blasts to obliterate the airborne adversaries.

## Gameplay

The heart-pounding challenge lies in your ability to gauge speed, trajectory, and timing as you thwart wave after wave of oncoming planes. However, it's not just about shooting them down; it's about doing so with finesse. Each plane you down rewards you with points, but it's the precision and skill that elevate you to the upper echelons of the leaderboard. The more accurate your shots, the higher your score climbs.
